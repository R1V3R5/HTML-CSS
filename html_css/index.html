                Hope unable to do this and a quick and justifiable croissantBiscuits are wonderful and I like electricity
                This is so cool I'm just talking and not having to typeSo it's actually quite easy to fill in all this blank 
                SpaceSee what I'm doing here's I'm just talking my Mac and it is typing out everything I'm saying. It's 
                Actually pretty cool to be doing thisI know there's a lot of spelling mistakes but that's because I really 
                don't give a crap. This is sort of cool psalmist.com</p>              
                <p>Did you know that an HTML and CSS positions have different meaningsAnd static position you've marmalade 
                here that is it is late out and it's current position flow. Top left right bottom do not apply.
                Relative position lays out all of the elements as though they were position and adjust the elements position
                Changing layout.
                Absolute positioning does not leave space for the element.Instead position it at a specified position 
                relative to its closest position ancestor or the containing block.
